/*
 *  chiTCP - A simple, testable TCP stack
 *
 *  Implementation of the TCP protocol.
 *
 *  chiTCP follows a state machine approach to implementing TCP.
 *  This means that there is a handler function for each of
 *  the TCP states (CLOSED, LISTEN, SYN_RCVD, etc.). If an
 *  event (e.g., a packet arrives) while the connection is
 *  in a specific state (e.g., ESTABLISHED), then the handler
 *  function for that state is called, along with information
 *  about the event that just happened.
 *
 *  Each handler function has the following prototype:
 *
 *  int f(serverinfo_t *si, chisocketentry_t *entry, tcp_event_type_t event);
 *
 *  si is a pointer to the chiTCP server info. The functions in
 *       this file will not have to access the data in the server info,
 *       but this pointer is needed to call other functions.
 *
 *  entry is a pointer to the socket entry for the connection that
 *          is being handled. The socket entry contains the actual TCP
 *          data (variables, buffers, etc.), which can be extracted
 *          like this:
 *
 *            tcp_data_t *tcp_data = &entry->socket_state.active.tcp_data;
 *
 *          Other than that, no other fields in "entry" should be read
 *          or modified.
 *
 *  event is the event that has caused the TCP thread to wake up. The
 *          list of possible events corresponds roughly to the ones
 *          specified in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9.
 *          They are:
 *
 *            APPLICATION_CONNECT: Application has called socket_connect()
 *            and a three-way handshake must be initiated.
 *
 *            APPLICATION_SEND: Application has called socket_send() and
 *            there is unsent data in the send buffer.
 *
 *            APPLICATION_RECEIVE: Application has called socket_recv() and
 *            any received-and-acked data in the recv buffer will be
 *            collected by the application (up to the maximum specified
 *            when calling socket_recv).
 *
 *            APPLICATION_CLOSE: Application has called socket_close() and
 *            a connection tear-down should be initiated.
 *
 *            PACKET_ARRIVAL: A packet has arrived through the network and
 *            needs to be processed (RFC 793 calls this "SEGMENT ARRIVES")
 *
 *            TIMEOUT: A timeout (e.g., a retransmission timeout) has
 *            happened.
